# 100  Days of LeetCode

## Why Am I Doing This?

I have recognized that in my online assessments, I quickly run out of time and have inefficient solutions. I know the theory around computer science very well and I am well versed in many coding languages and in implementation strategies, however the online assessments continue to stump me. Therefore, I am trying to complete a LeetCode problem and analyze my approach every day to consider where I am less advanced.
